# Marketing and SEO Playbook

Practical marketing and SEO guide for founders, product teams, and early-stage operators who need a clearer path from positioning to acquisition, measurement, and retention.

> *If I were defining go-to-market defaults for a product team today, I would start with five things first: a narrow audience, a credible message, pages that convert, measurement you can trust, and acquisition loops that compound instead of spike once and disappear.*

## Why this exists

Most marketing advice becomes harder to use the moment a team tries to apply it.

The problem is usually not lack of tactics. The problem is lack of structure:

- positioning, pages, content, SEO, and paid acquisition are treated like separate disciplines instead of one system;
- channel execution starts before the team is clear on audience, message, and proof;
- analytics gets added late, so reporting looks busy but does not support real decisions.

This repository is meant to be a more usable default.

It keeps the material in focused Markdown guides, but the underlying goal is simple: give teams a playbook they can read in sequence, revisit by topic, and use as a practical operating reference.

## The defaults I'd reach for first

If I were helping a product team build early marketing and SEO momentum today, I would usually start here:

- **Audience:** define one narrow ICP and one clear wedge before scaling channels
- **Positioning:** make the value proposition legible in a sentence the market actually uses
- **Trust:** publish real company, policy, and contact signals early
- **Website:** make landing, pricing, feature, and comparison pages work before trying to buy more traffic
- **Measurement:** define activation, conversion, and retention events before serious campaign spend
- **SEO:** treat search as intent matching plus technical hygiene plus credible content
- **Content:** build a few strong pillar assets before producing large volumes of thin posts
- **Acquisition:** use channels you can test cheaply and repeat, not just launch-day spikes
- **Paid media:** use paid search and remarketing to capture and re-engage demand, not to paper over weak positioning
- **Retention:** connect acquisition to onboarding, product value, and save flows so marketing is not judged only by signup volume

That model is intentionally boring. Boring is good when you want something repeatable.

## How this repository is organized

Unlike the other playbooks in this suite, this repository keeps most of the deep content in `docs/` instead of one giant root `README`.

That is a valid structure for this topic. Marketing and SEO often work better as linked reference chapters because teams revisit specific areas at different times:

- positioning when the product category shifts;
- landing and feature pages when conversion drops;
- technical SEO when content is live but search visibility lags;
- attribution when channels start competing for credit.

Use this `README` as the front door, and use the chapter files in `docs/` as the working handbook.

---

## Recommended reading path

Not every team needs every chapter in order, but this sequence is a good default:

1. Start with [Research and startup strategy](docs/research-and-strategy.md) to clarify the niche, demand signals, and early-stage risk.
2. Move to [Brand, positioning, and messaging](docs/brand-positioning-and-messaging.md) so the promise, ICP, and differentiation are explicit.
3. Add [Legal, privacy, and trust](docs/legal-compliance.md) before scaling forms, cookies, email, and public claims.
4. Tighten [Landing pages and on-site conversion](docs/landing-pages.md) and [Product UX, analytics, and support](docs/product-and-ux.md) so traffic has somewhere credible to land.
5. Layer on acquisition, content, and SEO with [Marketing I](docs/marketing-acquisition-and-channels.md), [Marketing II](docs/marketing-pages-and-attribution.md), [Content](docs/content-seo-and-blog.md), [SEO tools](docs/seo-tools-and-faq.md), and [Technical SEO](docs/technical-seo-and-site-health.md).
6. Close the loop with [Measurement, attribution, and experimentation](docs/measurement-attribution-and-experimentation.md), [Paid remarketing](docs/paid-media-remarketing.md), and [Frameworks and retention](docs/frameworks-and-retention.md).

For a simple ordered index, see [docs/index.md](docs/index.md).

## A practical operating model

This is the sequence I would want a team to internalize:

```txt
Research the niche
  -> define ICP and wedge
  -> write clear positioning and proof
  -> publish trust, policy, and contact basics
  -> improve landing, pricing, and onboarding paths
  -> launch acquisition and content loops
  -> strengthen technical SEO and information architecture
  -> measure activation, conversion, and retention
  -> add remarketing and experiments where traffic volume justifies them
  -> use retention and save flows to protect the value of acquired users
```

That flow matters because most marketing problems are not truly isolated. A weak conversion surface makes SEO look weak. Weak measurement makes paid channels look confusing. Weak retention makes every acquisition channel look more expensive than it really is.

---

## Things I would avoid

- trying to scale channels before the ICP and message are clear;
- publishing thin landing pages and expecting paid traffic to rescue them;
- treating SEO as keywords without information architecture, internal linking, and technical hygiene;
- using attribution reports as if they were ground truth instead of a decision aid;
- creating dozens of low-quality blog posts before a few strong pillar assets exist;
- mixing trust-sensitive behavior with vague legal or privacy posture;
- measuring signups without activation and retention context;
- assuming remarketing can solve a product, onboarding, or positioning problem.
